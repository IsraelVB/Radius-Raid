# Radius Raid #

Radius Raid is a space themed shoot 'em up where you must blast away unrelenting enemies before they destroy you. The game features 13 enemy types, 5 powerups, parallax backgrounds, retro sound effects, and locally stored stats.

This is an an entry for [isrvb](https://israelvb.github.io/lekeleaks/) 2013. The theme this year was bad luck, but I didn't work it into my game at all. There are certainly luck and chance factors that affect the gameplay, but those weren't built in for the competition.
